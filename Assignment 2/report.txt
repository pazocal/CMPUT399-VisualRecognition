The result is got from IMDB built with ANN algorithm, I tried the other one and the result are similar in trend.
As we can see from the table, geoVerification made an obvious improvement for the Jaccard score, 
therefore we can see the geoVerification improve the similarity. 
Since the similarity increases, the threshold value decreases at the same time, we only need a smaller value to find the best one.

Explanation£º
I changed some functions (say, convertToBinary) and I will upload them together, 
you can see the changes are obviously for naming the output files only. There is no structrual change.

Also, for dealing with the 100K case, I made another one constructIMDB.
