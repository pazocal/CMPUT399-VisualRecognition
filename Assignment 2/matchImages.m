% %%%%%%%  pseudo-code outline for matching %%%%%%%%
%
% for every pair of images that are at least seq_cutoff apart,
% call "matchWords" function to obtain number of matched words.
%
% If verify_geom variable is 0, divide number of matched words by the 
% number of words present in the image pair to compute the degree of match 
% between the image pair. Populate match_fracs matrix with the degree of match
%
% If verify_geom variable is 1, call "geometricVerification" function,
% which outputs number of inliers. Divide number of inliers by the 
% number of words present in the image pair to compute the degree of match 
% between the image pair. Populate match_fracs matrix with the degree of match
%
% Call supplied function "convertToBinary" to decide a suitable threshold
% for match_fractions. Match your binary matrix output (O) with ground truth 
% binary matrix (G) by computing Jaccard score: sum(sum(and(O,G)))/ sum(sum(or(O,G)))
