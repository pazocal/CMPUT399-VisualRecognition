%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% of the size 24x24xN where
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  - 24x24 is the pixel size of croped faces
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  - N is the number of samples

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% It's always good to look at the data
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% let's display a few positive and negative samples

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Positive training images have been manually aligned
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% by x-y coordinates. However, they may have large

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% we normalize pixel values of all samples to zero mean
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% and variance value=1

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% in the form of a vector. Let's flatten training images
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% into one vector per sample

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% make vectore with sample labels:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% +1 for positives
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -1 for negatives
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
ypos=ones(npos,1);
